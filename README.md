WORK IN PROGRESS.

Simple python program to remove all white(ish) pixels from a picture and make them transparent.

1 - Run the program

2 - Select a picture

3 - That's it. The transparent version will be added to the same folder

Features yet to be added :
- Proper GUI
- Selection of an entire folder instead of manually doing it pictures by pictures
- Larger format selection
